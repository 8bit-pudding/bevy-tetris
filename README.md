# bevy-tetris

It's Tetris, made with [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)!

Please note that I am very much still learning Rust and how to use Bevy, so
at any given point this implementation is probably "sub-optimal" (to put it
lightly) and in the process of being rewritten.

Suggestions and tips are always welcome!
